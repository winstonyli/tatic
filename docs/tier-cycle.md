# The kernel as the KR&R tier of a cyclical system

Status: direction and experiment plan (2026-10-10). The kernel side is built; the language-model side is not. Update the Results
section as experiments land.

## Idea
The overall system has tiers (see scratchtape's `README.md`, "Direction: tiered AI": a gradient-trained model on the GPU, knowledge
representation and reasoning (KR&R) on the CPU, working memory, long-term memory). tatic is the KR&R tier: a small trusted proof
kernel plus a rule miner. The tiers form a cycle rather than a stack:

- **LM -> kernel: what to explore.** The model proposes conjectures, candidate lemmas, or which family and shape to try next. Its
  output is untrusted.
- **Kernel -> LM: efficient reasoning.** The kernel accepts, rejects or proves each proposal. Proved laws are compiled into rewrite
  rules that replace long derivations, so later work is cheaper; verdicts and cost signals train the model.

## What exists (kernel side)
- The mine-and-serve loop (`scripts/loop_stream.sh`, `search::rule_miner`): laws are served in batches, rules are mined from them, M
  (laws still needing a whole-term machine proof) falls. Results and limits are in `docs/loop-result.md`.
- The explorer is not learned: a hash-ordered stream of a fixed family, and the miner's greedy candidate pool.
- Rule libraries plateau at about 25 rules on the current families: the fixed vocabulary saturates.

## Interface (to settle)
- Syntax across the boundary: the `show` syntax (`op(a, b)`, `0`, `-1`, variables `x y z`), parsed by `parse_term`. A law is
  `lhs = rhs`, a rule `lhs -> rhs`.
- Verdict per proposal, kernel -> LM: parse error, refuted by the width 1-6 screen, trivial (`lhs == rhs`), duplicate, known (already
  in the family), novel and true; for true laws, cheap (machine-free under the rules in force) or hard (needed a machine proof), and
  later proof size.
- Signals up, per round: M, per-rule use counts, the laws over budget (the frontier).

## Experiments
1. **Proposer yield** (kernel side done, see below). Given a proposer, what fraction of its samples parse, survive the screen, are
   new, and are hard? Baselines: uniform pool pairs and a character n-gram trained on verified laws. Swap a scratchtape LM in later.
2. **Does an LM-proposed stream mine better rules?** Feed accepted proposals into the loop and compare the mined rules' M reduction
   against the hash-ordered stream.
3. **Close the cycle.** Train on accepted laws, repeat, and track the frontier (hardest law provable within a fixed budget), not just
   M on a fixed stream.

## Risks
- Degeneration: the proposer repeats what it knows. Needs a novelty and difficulty filter from the kernel's signals.
- Soundness: only kernel-checked rules may enter the library. Machine-proved laws are checked; the ring-theory spike's lemmas are
  not (value screen only).
- Fixed vocabulary: more rules stop helping. Growth needs new operators or definitions, proposed by the model and checked
  conservatively (see the Boolean-comparison spec, local).
- Evidence so far is single runs on related add/sub/bitwise/comparison families.

## Results
### Experiment 1, kernel side (2026-10-10)
`search::classify_proposals` gives each proposed `lhs = rhs` line a verdict (unparsed, trivial, refuted, duplicate, memorised, known or
novel, each cheap or hard); the ignored test `proposal_yield` samples a proposer and prints a `YIELD` line (env documented on the test).
Baselines, 2000 samples, shuffle salt 1, default 250-law training window, no mined rules, one run each:

| family | proposer | unparsed | refuted | trivial/dup/memorised | true and new to the stream |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| add3 | uniform pool pairs | 0 | 1940 | 1 | 59 cheap |
| add3 | char 8-gram | 1517 | 472 | 11 | 0 |
| sbo3 | uniform pool pairs | 0 | 1960 | 0 | 1 known cheap, 38 cheap + 1 hard outside the family |
| sbo3 | char 8-gram | 1883 | 117 | 0 | 0 |
| cmp3d | uniform pool pairs | 0 | 1945 | 0 | 51 cheap + 4 hard outside the family |
| cmp3d | char 8-gram | 1983 | 17 | 0 | 0 |

Reading: random pool pairs are about 97% false (2-3% true); the n-gram mostly does not even parse (76-99%) and yields no true new
law, so a proposer must clearly beat both to be worth wiring in. "Outside the family" means true laws that the family's windowed
sequence omits (for example fewer than three variables); `known` counts only the family's own laws. With no rules installed the cheap
and hard split reflects only the built-in rules. Not yet run: the same with a mined library (`CHECK_RULES`), and a learned proposer.

## Related work (surveyed 2026-10-10)
Three subagents read the primary sources; items they could not confirm are marked UNVERIFIED. The "for tatic" lines are our inference.

**Self-play conjecturer and prover.**
- *Minimo* (Poesia et al. 2024, arXiv 2407.00695): one LM conjectures and proves; the proposer is conditioned on a difficulty level taken from percentiles of proof log-likelihood; novel-goal-only hindsight relabeling stops `0=0` collapse. The library stays fixed, which the paper names as its main limit (proofs get longer, not deeper).
- *STP* (Dong & Ma 2025, 2502.00212): the proposer signal is the sampled pass rate; keeps "barely provable" conjectures (pass rate in (0, 1/4]), dedups, drops by an elegancy ratio, and re-weights by embedding similarity after mode collapse. No library growth.
- Expert iteration (Polu et al. 2022, 2202.01344): fixed statement set, no conjecturer. LeanConjecturer (2506.22005): novelty by `exact?`, non-triviality by `aesop`; truth of conjectures is its stated open problem.
- For tatic: every system gives the proposer a graded signal and has an explicit anti-degeneration filter. The kernel's proof cost is a deterministic analogue of Minimo's log-likelihood. Growing the library is the stated gap, which is what the miner fills. None of the sources read closes conjecture, verify, mine rule, retrain, so it is unclaimed in this sample, not necessarily in the literature.

**Library learning.**
- *DreamCoder* (2006.08381) scores libraries by MDL; *Stitch* (2211.16605) is a fast compression miner (utility = corpus cost reduction minus abstraction cost); *Babble* (2212.04596) mines modulo an equational theory with e-graphs, so tatic's rules could play the role of its theory; *LILO* (2310.19791) adds an LLM synthesizer, a cap of 10 abstractions per iteration, and re-derives the library each round. LILO's naming and documenting of abstractions mattered (anonymous names hurt).
- *LEGO-Prover* (2310.00656) and *Voyager* (2305.16291) admit on verification only; bloat control is a similarity dedup at most; only 24% of LEGO's solved problems used retrieved lemmas.
- *FunSearch* and *AlphaEvolve* are the only systems with explicit proposer-collapse control (islands, signature clusters, resets). *AlphaGeometry* trains on synthetic traceback targets (which constructions a proof needed) with a fixed rule set.
- For tatic: a net-utility score (Stitch/LILO style) is the principled library-size control found; our 25-rule plateau has no counterpart measurement in the literature read.

**Rule and conjecture synthesis.**
- *Ruler* (OOPSLA 2021, 2108.10436) and *Enumo* (OOPSLA 2023): enumerate terms, group them by values on sampled inputs (cvecs), verify with a user validator, and keep a rule only if the kept set cannot derive it by equality saturation. No rule-count budget. Enumo's stricter LHS-only derivability test and its minimize-against-prior-rules step look reusable. The Enumo arXiv id the subagent reported looks wrong; cite the venue only.
- *QuickSpec* and *Hipster*: test-based conjectures proved in Isabelle; routine-provable ones are pruned from display. *IsaCoSy*: each proved theorem constrains later synthesis; 38% precision on lists, many uninteresting.
- *Souper* ranks replacements by instruction-count benefit weighted by profile counts, the nearest precedent for ranking by downstream cost. No theory-exploration tool read ranks by proof cost, so greedy mining by machine-proof-count reduction has no direct precedent there.
- Learned conjecturing (Urban & Jakubuv 2020, 2005.14664): GPT-2 on Mizar; 9000-10000 proved but not the interesting ones. Gauthier's conjecturing work: UNVERIFIED, not found.

**Ideas to take, in order of cheapness.**
1. A Ruler/Enumo-style derivability prune on the mined library: drop any rule the rest of the library derives. Cheap to test on the current libraries.
2. Minimo/STP-style difficulty targeting: proposer samples scored by the kernel (cheap vs hard, machine-proof count) and kept only in a band, instead of a boolean accept.
3. Collapse control borrowed from FunSearch: signature-clustered sampling with a length preference, using our existing width 1-6 value signature.
4. AlphaGeometry-style traceback: train the proposer on the sub-terms or lemmas a kernel proof actually used.
