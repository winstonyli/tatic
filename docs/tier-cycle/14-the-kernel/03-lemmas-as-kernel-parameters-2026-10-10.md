### Lemmas as kernel parameters (2026-10-10)
`shared_lemma` (rewrite.rs) checks each closed lemma's proof once and binds its statement as a parameter in a
`Postulates` scope of its own; the rewriter then uses the parameter (a `Free`) instead of the proof, and `ck` checks with
`check_open` against the parameters bound so far. One hook covers every closed lemma the proofs reuse: the mined rules, the built-in
add lemmas (assoc, identity, not, comm), `shrmask`, the GoodBv witness lemmas (`good_add`, `good_sub`, `good_shl1`, `good_shr1`) and
the machine proofs' case lemmas (`add_tree_law`'s `guarded`, which replaced its own `LEMMAS` cache). The `gbit` pairs stay inlined:
their first half is an operator that must compute. A lemma's proof may use lemmas bound before it (a mined rule proved through a
machine proof uses that proof's case lemmas), so the scopes nest in binding order. A law over parameters is not closed; `discharge`
closes the scopes innermost first, `(\r_0. .. ((\r_m. body) P_m) ..) P_0`, giving a closed term the plain checker accepts
(`a_law_over_lemma_parameters_discharges_to_a_closed_proof`, including a nested rule). M is unchanged.

This is the only path: the `LEMMA_PARAMS` switch that kept inlined proofs as the default was removed, and every check in the miner and
the tests goes through `holds`/`ck` (encoding.rs), which check against the parameters bound so far. The "off" columns below were
measured before the removal and are kept as the record of what inlining cost. The salt-1 cold and own-seeded loops (18 cells,
`scripts/experiments/cross_run.sh` with `CHECK_FAST=0`, so every served law is built and kernel-checked against the parameters) give
the same per-batch M and rule counts as the earlier count-only runs in every cell.

Kernel work (`law_work_report`, same windows and `record-defeq` caveat as above). `law_work_report` now also counts kernel visits
while building a proof, which is where the one-time lemma checks run:

| family, library | M | law-check visits (M), off / on | build visits (M), off / on | total (M), off / on | median machine-free law, off / on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sbo3, none | 92 | 11.7 / 2.5 | - / 22.9 | - / 25.3 | |
| sbo3, own | 17 | 12.9 / 1.2 | 8.6 / 11.5 | 21.5 / 12.7 | 32k / 2.3k |
| cmp3d, none | 118 | 40.5 / 4.8 | - / 99.0 | - / 103.9 | |
| cmp3d, own | 31 | 53.4 / 3.1 | 69.1 / 103.8 | 122.5 / 106.9 | 46k / 2.5k |

Normal build, `proof_cost_split`, own library, pinned to two cores, ABAB, machine quiet (7-15% CPU):

| family | CPU s off | CPU s on | law check s off / on (rule laws + machine laws) | build s off / on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| sbo3 | 9.7, 10.0 | 5.1, 5.2 | 6.0, 6.3 / 0.37, 0.37 | 2.9, 2.9 / 4.1, 4.3 |
| cmp3d | 58.3, 58.6 | 44.9, 45.2 | 32.2, 32.4 / 1.2, 1.3 | 23.4, 23.5 / 42.1, 42.4 |

A first version that bound only the rewriter's lemmas (not the case lemmas) cut law-check visits to 2.4M (sbo3) and 28.0M (cmp3d).

- **Checking a law is now cheap and a library cuts it.** Law checks fall 16-25x in time and 11-17x in visits; a machine-free law
  costs a median 2.3-2.5k visits. With parameters on both sides, the own library cuts law-check visits 2.1x on sbo3 (2.5M to 1.2M)
  and 1.6x on cmp3d (4.8M to 3.1M), the direction M predicts.
- **Total CPU falls 1.9x (sbo3) and 1.3x (cmp3d).** The rest is building, which now includes the one-time lemma checks. cmp3d's
  case lemmas are numerous and specific to a machine, so checking each once saves less than the rules do (total visits 122.5M to
  106.9M).
- **Building uses the kernel more than checking does.** Even with parameters off, building the proofs costs 8.6M (sbo3) and 69.1M
  (cmp3d) kernel visits, uncounted before this column.
