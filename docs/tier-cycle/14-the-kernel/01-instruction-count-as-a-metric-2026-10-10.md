### Instruction count as a metric (2026-10-10)
Question: can a precise count of work replace M (a 0/1 count per law) as the efficiency signal? A hardware count of retired
instructions needs admin on Windows (ETW) and changes with every rebuild, and wasmtime fuel counts only JIT code, not the kernel. So the
count is the kernel's own deterministic work. `law_work_report` (ignored, needs `--features record-defeq`; both removed in
306a968, restore with `git revert 306a968`) writes one row per law:
fallbacks, rule steps, proof size, nodes built while building the proof, kernel node visits while checking it (instantiate, shift,
eq, conv and nf whnf, infer misses), beta steps, and the build and check wall times. The data is 300 held-out shuffled laws (salt 1;
skip 2000 sbo3, 5000 cmp3d), the same windows as the credit runs. The times are from the `record-defeq` build, whose probes make it
about 4x slower than a normal build (sbo3 own library: rule-law check 23 s there, 5.4-6.2 s normally); compare them only with each
other:

| family, library | M | kernel visits (M) | check s | build s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| sbo3, none | 92 | 11.7 | 22.9 | 12.8 |
| sbo3, own (8 rules) | 17 | 12.9 | 22.1 | 6.3 |
| sbo3, from stream | 21 | 14.3 | 21.7 | 4.6 |
| sbo3, from band | 22 | 13.8 | 23.8 | 6.2 |
| sbo3, from mutants | 87 | 13.2 | 22.7 | 11.3 |
| cmp3d, none | 118 | 40.5 | 120.9 | 67.8 |
| cmp3d, own (8 rules) | 31 | 53.4 | 146.1 | 66.7 |
| cmp3d, from stream | 44 | 58.2 | 184.7 | 75.0 |
| cmp3d, from band | 44 | 38.2 | 104.8 | 47.3 |
| cmp3d, from mutants | 84 | 42.0 | 140.5 | 64.4 |

- **The count is a good proxy for time.** Per law, Spearman rho(visits, check time) is 0.97 on every sbo3 run and 0.86-0.96 on cmp3d.
  A samply profile of the sbo3 own-library run (non-feature build) puts about 67% of the time in the kernel check (`check_rc`,
  `def_eq`, `beta_spine`, `instantiate_n`, with hash-cons interning at 34% inclusive) and about 25% in building proofs (`rewrite_law`;
  the machine proofs' `add_tree_law` at 16%).
- **It ranks libraries differently from M.** The own, stream and band libraries cut M 3-5x, but kernel work stays flat or rises (sbo3 11.7M visits with no
  library, 12.9-14.3M with one; cmp3d 40.5M with none, 53.4M with its own). cmp3d's stream and band libraries tie on M (44) but differ
  by 1.5x in visits (58.2M vs 38.2M). Only build time falls (sbo3 12.8 s to 4.6-6.3 s).
- **Cause: each rule's proof is re-checked at every use.** `rule_step` applies the rule's proof term inline (`apps(law.0, ..)`), and
  each law is checked with fresh caches. A machine-free law under a mined library costs a median 32k visits, against 4.7k under the
  built-in rules alone. Checking the 8 sbo3 rule proofs once takes 0.76 s (`proof_cost_split`), against 22 s to check the 300 laws
  that re-check them. So under the current proof representation, M measures how many laws need a machine proof, not how much
  reasoning a library saves.
- **The count grades within M's classes, and the classes overlap.** Machine-free laws span 1.5k to 0.5-1.8M visits, machine-proved
  ones 25k to 0.4-3.7M. In every run, 28-122 machine-free laws cost more than the cheapest machine-proved law.
