### Hash-consing cost (negative, 2026-10-10)
Interning was 34% of the profiled time: about 15% in `instantiate_n` (interning its arguments for the memo key in `hc::args_id`, and
its results) and about 17% in the term constructors (`app2`, `lam`, `arrow`, `pi`, ...), almost all of it the table probe itself.
The hasher is already a pointer hash. Two prototypes (reverted) were run on `proof_cost_split`, sbo3 own library, 300 laws, pinned
to two cores (a mining job held six others), alternating runs:

| intern table | CPU s | peak memory | rule-law check s |
|---|---|---|---|
| one for the whole run (current) | 11.1-12.6 | 0.54 GB | 5.4-6.2 |
| one per law | 16.2-18.8 | 0.18 GB | 9.2-11.2 |
| none | 104-109 | 2.6 GB | 56-59 |

cmp3d (100 laws): 20.9 s and 0.99 GB with the table, 144 s and 9.6 GB without. The table is what makes the checks cheap: the proofs are
DAGs with about 140x sharing (sbo3 rule laws: 1.57M unique nodes against 220M without interning), and the table shared across laws
also reuses the instantiations of the inlined rule proofs. A table per law is slower, so it is not cleared between laws. What is left to
save is small: `args_id` re-interns arguments that are often already canonical (at most about 7% of the time, from the profile). The
real lever is not re-checking the rule proofs (above).
